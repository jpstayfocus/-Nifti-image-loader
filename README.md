# Nifti-image-loader
[Nifti](https://github.com/plwp/Nifti.NET/tree/master) image loader which is capable of asynchronously reading .nii files from disk and then displaying the image on an OpenGL texture. Nifti files are image files ending in a .nii extension, commonly used to store 3d or 4d medical imaging data.

FIles cannot be uploaded cause too large. Will upload a Google Link Soon...
